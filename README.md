# Tic Tac Toe

A web-based tic-tac-toe game created from React and Javascript.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies

- `npm install` — This will install all needed dependencies

2. Start server and play!

- `npm start` — This will spawn a development server with a default port of `1234`.

## If wanted to deploy

- `npm run build` — This will output a production build in the `dist` directory.

## Custom port

You can use the `-p` flag to specify a port for development. To do this, you can either run `npm start` with an additional flag:

```
npm start -- -p 3000
```

Or edit the `start` script directly:

```
parcel index.html -p 3000
```
